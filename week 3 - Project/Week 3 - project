Project details 
Personalized AI Assistant with Memory - 
Build an AI assistant that maintains memory over multiple conversations and retrieves information using a knowledge graph. Use LangGraph to integrate a dynamic 
knowledge base for enhanced retrieval.


i have created this applcation using RAG pipeline, i have used groq API , huggingface embeddings ,langchain, Neo4j for knowledgegraph 
here i have used wikipedia loader and fetch deatils and created graph in neo4j 

Steps for project
1. added all requeried library and added neo4j creadential 
2. using WikipediaLoader loaded deatails for Elizabeth I
3. applied chunking using TokenTextSplitter into small chunk
4. used "Gemma2-9b-It" LLM model and loaded that model into LLMGraphTransformer to read as graph 
5. llm_transformer.convert_to_graph_documents using this converted document to graph and stroed in graph_documents
6. used HuggingFaceEmbeddings
7. created prompt template 
8. Uses a structured LLM prompt to extract entities (e.g., people, organizations) from text and Executes Cypher queries to find relationships between entities in the Neo4j database.
9. for Information Retrieval used Structured Retrieval for Queries Neo4j for entity relationships and Unstructured Retrieval for Uses Hugging Face embeddings for semantic search.
10. for Standalone Questions added Answers based on structured/unstructured context and for Follow-up Questions Rephrases them using chat history.
